_Hi, I'm **Navid Rahman**, a computer science graduate with a passion for programming. I'm always learning new things and exploring the hidden roads of the programming world. I'm proficient in a variety of programming languages and technologies. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.

I'm always looking for how I can use my skills and experience to make a positive impact.

I hope to one day mount the peak of programming, but until then, I'll keep learning and exploring.

P.S. I'm also a real foodie, and you can always bribe me with good food._
